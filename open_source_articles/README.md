### What is open source?

* **Open-source** software is a type of computer software in which source code is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner.   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)


 * Open-source software (OSS) is any computer software that's distributed with its source code available for modification. That means it usually includes a license for programmers to change the software in any way they choose: They can fix bugs, improve functions, or adapt the software to suit their own needs.


 ## Open-Source Software Criteria

 The Open Source Initiative (OSI), a global nonprofit founded in 1998, acts as a leading authority on OSS. Its definition of open-source software includes ten criteria, relating to matters such as:

 > Software redistribution

 > Source code availability and integrity

 > Distribution and properties of licenses

 > Derived works

 > Anti-discrimination


 ## Licenses
* Different licenses allow programmers to modify the software with various conditions attached. According to the Black Duck KnowledgeBase, a database of some two million open source projects, five of the most popular licenses are:

1. MIT License

2. GNU General Public License (GPL) 2.0
3. Apache License 2.0
5. GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0
6. BSD License 2.0 (3-clause, New or Revised)



When you change the source code, OSS requires the inclusion of what you altered as well as your methods. The software created after code modifications may or may not be made available for free.


## Advantages

While its lack of cost is a key advantage, OSS has several additional benefits:

> Its quality can be easily and greatly improved when its source code is passed around, tested, and fixed.

> It offers a valuable learning opportunity for programmers. They can apply skills to the most popular programs available today.

> It can be more secure than proprietary software because bugs are identified and fixed quickly.

> Since it is in the public domain, and constantly subject to updates, there is little chance it can become unavailable or quickly outmoded‚Äîan important plus for long-term projects.


## Beginners to Open Source

This collection of articles is about what it's like to get started in open source, in any position and for any type of open source project. We're not just talking code here, though we do highlight many ways someone can get started coding, submitting pull requests, and working directly on the software side of an open source project. Open source methods are also used to make data more open, processes more transparent, and "secret recipes" like design files for farming equipment, housing, and 3D printable parts available to everyone.


## Get started with open source

Start with our  [What is open source?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source)      resource page for the basics.
