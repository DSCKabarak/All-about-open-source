Since differnt projects have different ways they organize themselves, understanding them is key before you start contributing.

## People associated with a typical open source file
1. Author - The person/organization that created the project 
2. Owner - The person who has administrative ownership over the organization or repository. It not a must it is the author.
3. Maintainers - Contributors who are responsible for driving the vision and mananging the organizational aspects of the project. They may also be authors or owners of the project.
4. Contributors - Eveyone who has contributed something back to the project.

## Files to expect on a repository/project 
1. LICENCE - If a project doesn't have an open source licence, then don't contribute to it, it's not an open source project. 
2. README - The manual that tells new users how to use/get started with the project.
3. Contributing - This file will ahbe instructions on how to contribute to the project. It can include the type of contributions needed, the process of how everything works. Some projects don't have this file.
4. Code_Of_Conduct - It not usually available in all project, but it contains a sets group rules for participants behavior associated and helps to facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment.

## Tools used to organize open source projects' discussions 
1. Issue trackers - Where people discuss issues related to the project.
2. Pull requests - Where people disucss and review changes that are in progress.  
4. Synchronous chat channel - Mediums such as slack are generally used for casual conversation, collaboration, and quick exhanges. 


## Finding a project to contribute to.
This is the most time consuming process when contributing to open source. You're usually expected to find an open source project you're comfortable contributing to. Generally, the projects you'll actively contribute to are the ones you find yourself coming back to, something you already use or want to use. Within those projects, when you catch yourself thinking that something could be better or different, act on your insticts. Or when you're new on the project, and you think that there is an issue that should be in the documentation, instead or ignoring it, you can act on it. 

## Submitting a contribution

1. Fork the project
This is making a copy of the original project. It gives you the ability to make changes without affecting the original project. 

2. Clone the project
This copies the project to your local machine, which will allow you to open the project in your favourite text editor or IDE. 
NB: If you clone the project without forking it first, you will not have the permission to contribute on the project.

3. Creating a branch
A branch is a neat way to manage your edits, without altering with the whole code base. You can name your branches in a such a way as to reference the issue you're fixing.

4. Make your changes
After you've made a branch, it safe to make your edit, this can include making code changes, updating a documentation, organizing the files, fixing a bug, etcs. It important to test your changes to make sure it doesn't break the exisitng solution already. Contribute in the style of the project to the best of your abilities, this including following the formatting used, semi-colons, comments etcs. 

5. Commit and push your changes
Committing your changes, is saving your changes and in the process you're supposed to explain in a few words the changes you made. The last step here is to push the changes to the origin, that is to repository on your GitHub account for example.

6. Create a pull request
This will enable the other contributors to see the changes you made. A pull request doesn't have to represent a finished work, you can open it earlier on, so others can waych and give feedback to your progress.  
Your contributions may not always be accepted, and if that happens, you can always ask for feedback and clarification. Don't argue or get hostile, you can always use the fork to work on your own version instead.
